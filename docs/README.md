# StartUp - Android Library

## Intro
StartUp provides a straightforward, performant way to initialize components (from library and/or application) at application startup.

## Getting Started
For information on how to get started with Flow Kit,
take a look at our [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.

## Submitting Bugs or Feature Requests
Bugs or feature requests should be submitted at our [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/zeoflow/startup/issues).

## How does it work?
### 1. Depend on our library

StartUp for Android is available through Maven's Repository.
To use it:

1.  Open the `build.gradle` file for your application.
2.  Make sure that the `repositories` section includes Maven's Repository
    `mavenCentral()`. For example:

    ```groovy
      allprojects {
        repositories {
          mavenCentral()
        }
      }
    ```

3.  Add the library to the `dependencies` section:

    ```groovy
      dependencies {
        // ...
        implementation 'com.zeoflow:startup:1.0.0'
        // ...
      }
    ```
